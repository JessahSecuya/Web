            <h1>LET'S EXPLORE THE DIVERSITY OF DOG BREEDS</h1>
            <p>
                People have been breeding dogs since prehistoric times. The earliest dog breeders used wolves to create domestic dogs. From the beginning, humans purposefully bred dogs to perform various tasks. Hunting, guarding, and herding are thought to be among the earliest jobs eagerly performed by the animal destined to be called “man’s best friend. For thousands of years, humans bred dogs toward the physical and mental traits best suited for the work expected of them.
